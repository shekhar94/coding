I specialise in web development. 
The technology stack I am most comfortable with is Nodejs, Mongodb, Postgresdb, Angularjs. 
I am vary passionate about programming javascript applications apart from that I have keen 
interest in working on C++ and python based projects.

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology from National Institute Of Technology Patna with
merit certificate from Director for Branch Topper 2016 batch.
I have over 2 years of experience in developing, deploying, and maintaining web applications, 

In my spare time I enjoy playing table tennis,
learning new programming languages, reading books.

I think a person needs right opportunity at right time to unfold his/her true potential and
when I look around me at Cybernetyx it feels like this is the place where I could 
unravel my true potential.

Please get in touch especially if you think I could be helpful for you by any means.

Extreme programming is an emotional experience.
The best of me is yet to come
