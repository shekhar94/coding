I specialise in web development. The technology stack I am most comfortable with is Nodejs, Mongodb, Postgresdb, Angularjs. I am vary passionate about programming javascript applications apart from that I have keen interest in working on C++ and python based projects.

I hold a Bachelor of Information Technology from National Institute Of Technology Patna with
merit certificate from Director for Branch Topper 2016 batch.
I have over 2 years of experience in developing,deploying, and maintaining web applications, 
with Outstanding performer award from my last company.

Iâ€™m a coding nomad and unlike most I like to spend my quality time alone.

In my spare time I enjoy playing table tennis,
learning new programming languages, reading books.

Please get in touch especially if you think I could be helpful for you by any means.

Extreme programming is an emotional experience.
The best of me is yet to come
