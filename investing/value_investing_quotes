It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong

Many businesses are so diverse or difficult to understand 
that they simply cannot be valued.
(Banking stocks are example of this even bankers don't 
know their exact value, Biotech companies)

selectivity undoubtedly improves an investors results..
investors who confine themselves to what they know..
have a considerable advantage over everyone else.

Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing

Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what
you are looking for is like running through a dynamite
factory with a burning match. You may live, but you are
still an idiot.
