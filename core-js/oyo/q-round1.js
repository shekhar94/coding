1. Given matrix
[
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [1,2,3,4,5]
]
Let's assume you have two pointers (a,b) and (c,d) (c>a, d>b)pointing to
two different entries in two-d array. Find the sum of all the 
elements which are part of the rectangle created by these two points.
Optimize time complexity to O(n). Preprocessing on the array elements 
is allowed. n*m space is also allowed.
