/* 
1. Given a string "ADBCBA". 
Find the length of longest palindromic sub-sequence.
For "ADBCBA" longest sub-sequence is ABCBA and length is 5.
Hint: Dynamic programming build in bottom up fashion.
Try to find sub-sequence of length 1 then 2 then 3
and so on. 


2. Given k sorted arrays each of size n. Print numbers 
in ascending order by merging all of them. Time complexity
should be of order of (k*n*logn).
Hint: Use min heap

3. Design database schema for Uber

4. Different types of hashing. How collisions are handled.
