        Prefer keeping the scripts tags in the head section with async
        attribute for third party libraries which are in-depended like 
        Google Analytics, Google reCAPTCHA or anything else which doesnâ€™t 
        need DOM access as the respective scripts are downloaded in 
        parallel but executed immediately.


        Use defer for all the other scripts loaded in head section as 
        these will also be downloaded in parallel but executed only after 
        HTML parsing has completed and DOM is ready for access/manipulation.


        You can also utilize combining DOMContentLoaded listener 
        inside async scripts to execute the functionality later.

    <script>
      window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
        console.log("DOM fully loaded and parsed");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
