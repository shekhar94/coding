// Q1: Given a set of mutual friends in a class, can you divide
// the class in two groups such that:
// For all students in a group, each student is a 
// friend of every other student?

// Note: Friendship is not transitive, i.e. 
// if A and B are friends, and B and C are friends, 
// it does not imply that A and C are friends.

// Two Clique Problem (Check if Graph can be divided in two Cliques)
// Check whether a given graph is Bipartite or not

// A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be 
// divided into two independent sets, U and V such that 
// every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U 
// to V or a vertex from V to U. In other words, 
// for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, 
// or u belongs to V and v to U. 
// We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.

// A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using 
// two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. 
// Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using 
// two colors. For example, see the following graph.
