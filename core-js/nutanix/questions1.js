Lets assume its a wallet how you will invalidate the token once
some transaction happens and user reports for the same.

How JWT works

Eager vs Lazy
Promise and Observable which one is eager and which is lazy? why?
The first difference is that a Promise is eager, whereas an Observable is lazy.
The Promise in the above example is eager, since the callback function provided to a
Promise constructor function is executed immediately.

If you create an Observable, you provide a callback
function that will be called upon invoking subscribe
method on the Observable object.

The next difference is that a Promise object
may provide only a single value.
It can be an array but itâ€™s still a single object.
On the contrary, an Observable may emit multiple values over time.
