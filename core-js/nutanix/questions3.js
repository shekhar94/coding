/* 
Design: 
This will be focused on component level design. 
Candidate should also be able to explain 
different design and technologies choice made during the design.



Lets assume you have to build generic authentication module for
e-commerce, wallet, and other services provided by nutanix(sso).
What would be your approach. How would you go about frontend page.
What all features you will add in login page.
Signup, Forgot Password

After building Authentication module.
Lets assume using same token if you want to
allow user to get logged in how would you do that.
Here wallet has more security than e-commerce
and other services has less security than e-commerce

After discussing priority table
Where would you keep priority table so that token can
be checked and validated quickly

After designing the application
Which parts of the authentication module you think you will test yourself?
Which parts you will expect to be tested by QA team.

What you think is best way to get testing done. 
(parallel, or dev should be 1 sprint ahead of QA).
How would you go about fixing bugs in already developed feature.
