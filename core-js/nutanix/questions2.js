/*
DS and Algorithm :
Candidate will be interviewed for data structure and algorithm.
Candidate should be able to write efficient code having
low time and space complexity.

Given two singly linked list.
Elements are sorted in decreasing order.
Merge ll1 and ll2 without using any extra space.
Finally ll1 should contain elements sorted in increasing order.

ll1: 30->25->20->18->14
ll2: 22->19->15->10->7

final value of 
ll1: 7->10->14->15->18->19->20->22->25->30

Design cache
What all interfaces it will expose
How you will maintain the cache so that it is time and memory efficient
Design LRU cache
