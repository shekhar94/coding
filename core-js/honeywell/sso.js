Federated Identity Glossary
The concept of a centralized or linked electronic identity is known as
federated identity. Federated identity systems handle several concerns:

Authentication
Authorization
User attributes exchange
User management

Different protocols
If you have been reading about SSO online,
you have probably found that there are many
different implementations: OpenID Connect,
Facebook Connect, SAML, Microsoft Account
(formerly known as Passport), etc.
Our advice is to choose whatever is 
simplest for your development efforts.
